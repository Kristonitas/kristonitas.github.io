Vilnius University students organise [Fidi](http://www.fidi.lt): a yearly student festival that is officially recognised by Vilnius city and is themed around phyisics. I got the opportunity to make a 10 second video commercial for the event, that would be displayed in city's public transport.

I got more people involved by distributing the rendering time across different computers (manually saving different files with predefined rendered frame ranges).
