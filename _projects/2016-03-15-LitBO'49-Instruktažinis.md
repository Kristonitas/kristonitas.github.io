Together with other volunteers at LGMOA we created a video that comicly introduces high school students to the laboratory experiment rules that are happening during the national science olympiads.

In this video I was responsible for everything and went a bit off the rails towards geeky and gaming culture that I inhabit. I am also to blame for bad focus, in my defense it was freezing cold and we shot everything in one day. Everything was achieved with After Effects and some image editing with Gimp.
