[Olimpiados.lt](https://olimpiados.lt)

Repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Kristonitas/olimpiados.lt

Olimpiados.lt is a site dedicated for listing information about various national and international competitions for school students.

This is the third iteration of the website that I am working on. The first one was based on old version of Joomla that I took over to maintain. Later I updated the Joomla version to try and combat the exploited site voulnrabilities. The final version (current) is made completely from scratch using Ruby on Rails and with a fresh install of Debian 8 (Jessie).
