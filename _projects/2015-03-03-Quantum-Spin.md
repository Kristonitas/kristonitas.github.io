I had a goal to make as small a game as possible and to actually release it on Google Play store. After some policy changes on the store, the game was taken down, but a fully functional version is [still available online](https://kristonitas.github.io/quantum-spin/)! All of the graphical assets and code was created from scratch by me.

I used the same tools as I did while working at NECOLT and developing Hadron Wars. The game was based on HTML5 and packed into an app, using [Cocoon.js, which unfortunately is now discontinued](hhttps://blog.cocoon.io/shutting-down-cocoon/). Javascript was compiled from CoffeeScript, the rendering is powered by [PixiJs](http://www.pixijs.com/).
