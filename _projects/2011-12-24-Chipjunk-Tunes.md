I took favorite chiptunes from various sources. One of the most prominant artist is LHS, famous for his [MYTH installer tracks]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YCWJd_yaYs). All the tracks were in some sort of MIDI format, mixed together using Audacity with custom-edited transition melody variations between some of the songs (others just fit perfectly one after another).

The mix was burnt to CD and the cover image was printed on top of it.
