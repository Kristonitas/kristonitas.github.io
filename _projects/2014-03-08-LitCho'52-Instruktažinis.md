Together with other volunteers at LGMOA we created a video that comicly introduces high school students to the laboratory experiment rules that are happening during the national science olympiads.

I wanted to have motion tracking and compositing, green screens and epic transitions... This video required a big collaborative effort, since there were multiple locations and a big scope that we set out to achieve. My main responsibilities were special effects. I was also involved with the editing and was present in all of the shooting. While the final result is cringy, it reminds how imagination and dedication overwhelms the lack of experience.
