  "Maurits Cornelis Escher (1898-1972) is one of the world's most famous graphic artists. His art is enjoyed by millions of people all over the world, as can be seen on the many web sites on the internet. He is most famous for his so-called impossible constructions, such as Ascending and Descending, Relativity, his Transformation Prints, such as Metamorphosis I, Metamorphosis II and Metamorphosis III, Sky & Water I or Reptiles.",
  "M.C. Escher, during his lifetime, made 448 lithographs, woodcuts and wood engravings and over 2000 drawings and sketches. Like some of his famous predecessors, - Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Dürer and Holbein-, M.C. Escher was left-handed.",
  "‘‘I could fill an entire second life with working on my prints‘‘<br><br>‘‘At moments of great enthusiasm it seems to me that no one in the world has ever made something this beautiful and important‘‘<br><br>‘‘The things I want to express are so beautiful and pure‘‘",
  "It’s a lithograph print, first printed in January 1935. The piece depicts a hand holding a reflective sphere. In the reflection, most of the room around Escher can be seen, and the hand holding the sphere is revealed to be Escher’s.",
  "Eye is an excellent example of the technique referred to as globular reflection. This means that when Escher drew this sketch he drew it from looking at it in a reflection. In this case the eye, his own as a matter of fact was drawn from its reflection in a concave shaving glass.",
  "In the 20th century, many artists rejected the notion that art should represent reality, and Escher was among them. His extreme perspectives, fantastical worlds, and impossible figures are all examples of this. Escher's goal is to force his viewers to acknowledge that art is not reality.",
  "It depicts a world in which the normal laws of gravity do not apply. The architectural structure seems to be the centre of an idyllic community, with most of its inhabitants casually going about their ordinary business, such as dining.",
  "There is a metamorphosis from a human figure to geometric pattern, which changes to a diamond form, and then the diamonds go to make up a block that is used as building material and thereupon, within some secret chamber of the house.",
  "Painting depicts a sheet of paper out of which, from wrists that remain flat on the page, two hands rise, facing each other and in the paradoxical act of drawing one another<br>into existence."
